Keymaster is an idle game that we are creating. The files will be stored in this repository. A changelog can be found if you click "Commits".

The current vision for this product is a completed idle game with an upgrade/automation system, well designed enemies and UI, and engaging gameplay. The game can almost entirely be accessed on one screen. The core gameplay consists of typing specific keys that are shown on screen, with a steady difficulty increase and eventual purchase of helpful tools to automate the process. The gameplay is kept fresh by modifiers and other gameplay aspects that tweak the original game.
