Keymaster is an idle game that we are creating in Godot 4. The files will be stored in this repository. A changelog can be found if you click "Commits".

The current vision for this product is a completed idle game with an upgrade/automation system, well designed enemies and UI, and engaging gameplay. The game can almost entirely be accessed on one screen. 
The core gameplay consists of typing specific keys that are shown on screen to defeat enemies, with a steady difficulty increase and eventual purchase of helpful tools to automate the process. 
The gameplay is kept fresh by modifiers, such as shielded enemies that take more than 1 string of text to defeat, speedy enemies that require you to defeat them within a specific time limit, 
and other such small tweaks to mess with the player.
